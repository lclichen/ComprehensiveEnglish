### Question 19143053
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">M: Hi, Jane. How is your vacation?<br />
W: Terrific! I went to Washington D.C. to visit my cousin. I saw the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the Smithsonian Institution, and the White House.<br />
M: I’ve never been to Washington. What did you like the best?<br />
W: Oh, the White House. Did you know that it’s been the official home of our presidents since 1800? And every president except George Washington has lived in it.<br />
M: I didn’t know it was that old. Is it really as nice as everyone says it is?<br />
W: It’s only a three-storey building built of stone. But it’s simple and definite. It used to be called the “President’s House”. President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901. The White House has a fascinating history. It survived a fire at the hands of the British in 1814.<br />
M: I remember now. The president then was James Madison. And his wife Dolley ran out of the burning building carrying Gilbert Stuart’s portrait of Washington.<br />
W: Yes, that’s right. It’s hanging in the East Room now.<br />
M: How big is the White House?<br />
W: It’s big. Imagine 18 acres of land with gardens and 132 rooms. It has to be painted every four years.<br />
M: How much were you allowed to see?<br />
W: Not very much. Only six of the rooms are open to the public. It’s a popular tour, and there is always a line of people waiting. They want to look at their property, I guess.<br />
M: Their property?<br />
W: Sure. The White House is owned by the people of the United States. We elect the leaders who live in it.<br />
M: But can just anyone go inside?<br />
W: Of course. Anyone can see our president’s home.</div>

We’re going to the new action movie, right?</p><p>W: Ugh! I hate those kinds of movies. I don’t want to see an action movie! You’ve played violent video games all day! Enough violence!

### Question 1000910403
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">Genes are the parts of cells that control the growth of living things, including people. Now, a company in Iceland is working to create the most detailed map yet of all known human genes. Doctor Karl Stefansson, head of the company, believes that the people of Iceland present a special chance to study the human genome and how some genes cause disease. Iceland has a very small population—about 280,000 people. The majority of the population shares a small group of common ancestors who lived thousands of years ago. The people of Iceland keep extensive records of their ancestors. In addition, Iceland has an excellent healthcare system. Doctor Stefansson says his researchers are studying genetic diseases in many families over hundreds of years. So far, researchers have examined the genes of at least 146 families. The Iceland genome project is using a much larger group of individuals to observe differences in human genes than any other project. For example, American scientists made a genetic map based on only eight large families in France. Human beings have almost exactly the same genes. Small genetic differences make us look different from each other. These differences can also make us more likely to get some diseases. The company's main project is to identify genes that cause disease. Scientists believe most common diseases are caused by several abnormal genes working together. The company claims to have already found three disease-causing genes, linking to a mental disease and two kinds of strokes.</div>

### Question 19142111
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">Obesity rates among children in Asia-Pacific are rising at a rapid rate. The number of overweight children under five rose 38 percent between 2000 and 2016 in the region, and the problem is growing, said a food safety and nutrition officer at the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization in Bangkok.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The rate of growth in obesity in Asia-Pacific is higher than in many other countries. While the United States leads the way on obesity rates, the number of overweight children in Asia-Pacific is rising rapidly,&nbsp;and many countries in this region are now among the most health-threatened in the world.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Adult obesity rates are highest in the United States, Mexico, New Zealand and Hungary, and lowest in Japan and South Korea. But the rapid rise in obesity among young people in Asia-Pacific is worrying because overweight children are at higher risk of becoming obese as adults and then developing serious health problems like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and liver disease.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand are among the most overweight countries in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;Many of these nations are also struggling to tackle malnutrition among their citizens.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The cost to the Asia-Pacific region of citizens being overweight or obese is $166 billion a year, a recent report by the Asian Development Bank Institute said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Rising wealth levels over the last 20 years have played a major role in the rise in obesity levels, researchers say. The region has undergone economic growth, so food has become available at a relatively cheaper price. For the last 20 years the economic growth has been almost uninterrupted.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In addition to consuming more, as economies have grown, people in Asia-Pacific have moved away from farming into manufacturing, and then to service sector jobs, which are more sedentary, characterized by much sitting and little physical exercise. City-dwellers in Asia-Pacific can spend hours commuting, and when they finally reach home they have little time to cook. Many opt to eat out.&nbsp;This new lifestyle has caused a rise in the consumption of convenience and processed foods, which often contain excess fats and more salt and sugar. People in the region also struggle to maintain a balanced diet with meals often lacking vegetables.&nbsp;</div>

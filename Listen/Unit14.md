全文资源：<p>W: Hello Son! How are you and your wife? When’s the baby due?</p><p>M: uh Hi mom … We’re doing well … Kelly is having the baby any minute now! I’ve finished painting the baby’s room, but I haven’t finished the baseball decorations. The baseball decorations have to be perfect for the baby’s room you know …</p><p>W: Son? Baseball? This baby isn’t born yet. How do you know the baby will like baseball?</p><p>M: When Kelly and I talked about the new baby’s room, I told her the one thing it had to have is a baseball theme. Baseball. Baseball, mom. Just like dad and me.</p><p>W: Son, your father loved you so much. Going to baseball games with you was important for him to show how much he loved you. He worried that he worked too much and didn’t spend enough time with you. But he always made time to take you to baseball games.</p><p>M: Dad was the best dad. He worked so hard at the company for so many years to make sure he took good care of us. I always remember the Saturdays he took me to the ball park. We would get up early, and he would make me a nice breakfast before we left for the game. Oh mom. I miss dad so much.</p><p>W: I know, son, I miss him so much, too. All the time, every day.</p><p>M: I just kept thinking that if I put up the baseball decorations in the baby’s room before the baby is born, it would be like dad is here to welcome the baby home even though he’s not alive to be here in person.</p><p>W: Well, we have his memory, his great love of all his family and baseball! I can’t wait to see the room. Did you paint it blue?</p><p>M: I did! A blue room full of the love of baseball!</p>

### Question 1000863894
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The favorite food in the United States is the hamburger, a kind of round sandwich of cooked ground beef. The favorite place to buy a hamburger is a fast food restaurant. At fast food restaurants, people order their food, wait a few minutes, and carry it to their tables themselves. People also take their food out of the restaurant and eat it in their cars or in their homes. At some fast food restaurants, people can order their food, pay for it and pick it up without leaving their cars.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many kinds of fast food restaurants in the United States. The most numerous sell hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes, which are traditionally popular foods among Americans. In addition, fast food restaurants that serve Chinese food, Mexican food, Italian food, chicken, seafood and ice cream are very numerous.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The idea of a fast food restaurant is so popular that nearly every kind of food can be found in one. Fast food restaurants are popular because they reflect American lifestyle.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First, they are not formal restaurants. Customers wear any type of dress when they go to a fast food place.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, they are fast. People who are busy do not want to spend time preparing their own food or waiting while someone else prepares it. In fast food restaurants the food is usually ready before the customer even orders it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, most food in a fast food restaurant is not expensive. Therefore, people can afford to eat at a fast food restaurant often, while they may not be able to afford a more traditional and more expensive restaurant very often.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

### Question 10124622
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">As one of NASA’s researchers and engineers, I believed that we have identified a planet 1,400 light years away which closely resembles Earth. The planet, named Kepler-452b after the Kepler telescope that detected it, is about 60% larger in diameter than Earth and is located in the constellation Cygnus, the swan&nbsp;zodiac sign.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We found that Kepler-452b fires the planet hunter’s imagination because it is the most similar to the Earth-sun system found yet: a planet at the right temperature within a habitable zone, and only about one and a half times the diameter of Earth, circling a star very much like our own sun.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A delicate balance allows Earth to support life. As we orbit the huge star we call the sun, the earth rotates at a distance just close enough to maintain liquid water and comfortable temperatures. Such a sweet spot in a solar system, called a “habitable zone,” or “goldilocks&nbsp;zone,” is the most likely place to find life beyond our planet. Until yesterday, at least a dozen planets had been located in habitable zones throughout the universe. But none had the winning combination of features that makes Kepler-452b so similar to Earth.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It’s these favorable characteristics that would make life on Kepler-452b possible. However, if there were life on Kepler-452b, it would be quite different from life on Earth. Because it is thicker than Earth, everything would weigh much more there, there are a lot of unknowns about how life would evolve on another planet. But the same physics that work on Earth would work elsewhere, so it’s possible that life would follow a similar development. Nature can find common solutions to common problems.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So what’s next? Well, Kepler-452b is too far away for humans to visit. But the discovery of this new Earth-like planet can tell us a lot about what’s possible for the future of space travel. NASA’s scientists said, the next step in the process is to do follow-up missions to find planets similar to Kelper-452b, but much closer to Earth. We could do a lot more follow-up with those planets, and even start to think about visiting one day.</div>

***A : It is the most similar to the Earth-sun system found so far.***
B : It circles the sun, just like Earth.
C : The temperature on it is extremely high.
D : It is the first planet the Kepler telescope discovered.
解析：细节题。音频中提到，Kepler-452b是目前最接近日地系统的行星。所以选B。

Question：Which of the following statements about Kepler-452b is true?
音频：<audio id="audio" controls="" preload="none"><source id="mp3" src="https://itestres.unipus.cn/itest-product/quesres/hearmp3/b_1097/paper/201709/p_10101259/gchkhz_01180618214.mp3"></audio>
本地缓存路径：Unit14/10124622.mp3
A : Life on Kepler-452b, if there were, will be the same as Earth.
***B : Kepler-452b is thicker than Earth so weight of everything is different.***
C : People already understood how life evolves on another planet.
D : Kepler-452b is believed to have life on it because it looks like Earth.
解析：细节题。音频中提到，Kepler-452b比地球厚重，因而上面的重量是不一样的。其上面如果有生命，形态也与地球上的大不同。所以选A。

Question：According to the scientists, what is the next step after this discovery?
音频：<audio id="audio" controls="" preload="none"><source id="mp3" src="https://itestres.unipus.cn/itest-product/quesres/hearmp3/b_1097/paper/201709/p_10101259/ikaeyo_01180618215.mp3"></audio>
本地缓存路径：Unit14/10124622.mp3
A : To stop studying Kepler-452b because it is too far.
B : To make more researches on Kepler-452b’s similarities with Earth.
C : To make plans for space travel to Kelper-452b.
***D : To find planets similar to Kelper-452b but closer to Earth.***
解析：细节题。音频最后提到，由于Kepler-452b距离地球过于遥远，科学家下一步将继续寻找和地球相似且距离近一些的行星，甚至在未来的某一天抵达那里。所以选B。

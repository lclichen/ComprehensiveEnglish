### Question 10966
全文资源：&nbsp; Losing weight could be as straightforward as turning on the kitchen tap. A new study found that middle-age and older adults who drank a couple of glasses of water before each meal lost about 30 percent more weight than those who didn't.<O:P></O:P> <br><P>&nbsp; Common wisdom has long held that drinking water before meals can promote weight loss, but there were no studies proving the point. To test it, researchers at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg assigned 48 overweight men and women aged 55 to 75 to one of the two groups. Both groups consumed low-fat, low-calorie diets for 12 weeks, but one group was told to drink two 8-ounce glasses of water before breakfast, lunch and dinner.<O:P></O:P></p><P>&nbsp; At the end of the 12 weeks, the water drinkers shed about 15.5 pounds, while the other group dropped about 11 pounds. Davy and her colleagues found that after a year both groups succeeded in keeping the pounds off, but those who continued to drink water before meals lost even a bit more, an average of 1.5 pounds. Why is water so effective? She says it may be because it fills the stomach with a zero-calorie fluid, so people eat less.<O:P></O:P></p><P>&nbsp; Drinking water before meals may work only if you've reached middle age. Researchers believe that in younger people, water begins to leave the stomach almost immediately. But in older people, it takes longer for the stomach to empty so they feel full for a longer time.<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 宋体; mso-font-kerning: 0pt" lang=EN-US><O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>

### Question 19142108
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">When it comes to writing your résumé, size does matter. How long should your&nbsp;résumé&nbsp;be?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If your résumé is too&nbsp;short, recruiters and hiring managers will think you don’t have a lot to bring to the table. On the flip side, if your résumé is too long, readers will likely get bored or annoyed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So, what’s the middle ground for writing your résumé? While there’s no hard-and-fast rule, your industry and level of experience can help you determine if your résumé should be one or two pages or more pages long.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The&nbsp;one-page résumé&nbsp;is ideal for entry-level workers, new college graduates, and those who have a few years of work experience. Additionally, you should consider a one-page résumé if you’re looking to&nbsp;make a career change&nbsp;and don’t have much experience relevant to your new goal.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hiring managers are busy people, sometimes having to sort through hundreds of applications. So, how can you make good use of your résumé real estate and really&nbsp;stand out? By&nbsp;being strategic with keywords,&nbsp;quantifying your achievements, and, most importantly, keeping it concise.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
That doesn’t mean you&nbsp;have<i>&nbsp;</i>to put all of your experience on one page with tiny characters&nbsp;that you need a magnifying glass to read.&nbsp;Readability and overall presentation need to be factored in, too.&nbsp;Most résumé reviewers would rather read a well-laid-out, easy-to-skim, two-page résumé than a one-page résumé that jams too much information on the page.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A two-page résumé makes sense for many job seekers, especially those who are further along in their career, with 10 or more years of relevant job experience. The extra page may be needed to convey all of the critical information an employer needs to know. Keep in mind, however, that the second page likely won’t get as much attention as the first, so it’s best to make sure you’re using the&nbsp;right résumé format.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Most people believe résumés should fit on two pages max, no matter how long you’ve been working. However, as with all rules, there are some exceptions. For example, if you work for the federal government; you’re a senior-level manager with a long track record of accomplishments; or you’re writing an academic résumé for a research or scientific position and have an extensive list of publications, speaking engagements, professional courses, licenses, or certifications; then you may need to extend your résumé to three or more pages.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the end, the length doesn’t matter quite as much as the content filling the pages. If you can capture your qualifications on one page, great. But if it takes two pages or more, that’s OK, too.</div>

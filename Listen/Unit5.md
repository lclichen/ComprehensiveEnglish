### Question 19154952
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">M: Today, our guest is Rosie Mullender, who works as a features editor for a fashion magazine. Hi Rosie, you’re a features editor at one of the most widely-read women’s magazines in the U.K. What kind of responsibilities does that job entail?<br />
W: We spend our days looking at ideas from journalists, writing copy for the magazine and website, and editing. We do random things like asking people in the street questions and testing sports clothing. We also do less tangible things like understanding what our readers want. It’s certainly varied and sometimes bizarre.<br />
M: During your working day what kind of work might you typically do?<br />
W: My day mainly incorporates responding to emails, writing and editing stories and coming up with new feature ideas.<br />
M: How does the job of features editor differ from that of fashion editor or other editorial positions?<br />
W: The features team deals with articles such as careers, reports, confidence and confessions—everything except fashion and beauty.<br />
M: A lot of people believe that working at a magazine is a glamorous job. Is this an accurate representation of what you do?<br />
W: I’d say it’s glamorous to an extent, but not in the way it’s portrayed in films. We do have our moments, such as interviewing celebrities and attending parties, which is a huge thrill. Ultimately though, we’re the same as our readers, but working in a job we’re all very lucky to have.<br />
M: Did you have to overcome any difficulties to reach this point in your career? How did you manage to do this?<br />
W: I had to be really persistent and it was very hard work. After three years of working in a petrol station and doing unpaid work, I still hadn’t managed to get an entry-level job. I was lucky that my last desperate attempt led to a job. I told myself that all experiences make you a better journalist in the long run and luckily, I was right.</div>

### Question 10906
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; Technology experts, government officials, policy makers and engineers are meeting this week in Italy. They have gathered in Rome for the first Green Standards Week conference.<br />&nbsp; Italy's Ministry of Economic Development and the International Telecommunications Union organized the conference. The event calls attention to the need for information and communication technologies to fight climate change and to build greener, more environmentally-friendly economies.<br />&nbsp; In recent years, the world has changed because so many people now use computers, mobile phones and other kinds of electronic devices. But the increasing use of information and communication technologies also has led to more pollution, especially&nbsp;carbon dioxide&nbsp;emissions. This is mostly because of the energy used to manufacture, transport and operate such equipment. Still, many experts say these technologies offer the best chance for reducing greenhouse gases.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; The Global Information Society reported last year that information and communication technologies could help to cut total production of greenhouse gases by as much as 15 percent by 2020.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Alan Finlay, an expert in economy, says the effect of using information and communication technologies to build cleaner environments is far more powerful than their harmful effects.<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; He says when people are looking at greening with information technologies, they are looking at the impact of these technologies on the environment but also what these can be used in order to improve the impact of other industries on the environment. And these technologies can do more good in a sort of bigger context.<span style="font-family: 宋体; font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 宋体; mso-font-kerning: 0pt" lang="EN-US"></span></div>

### Question 19154944
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever had someone try to explain something to you a dozen times with no luck, but then when you see a picture, the idea finally clicks? If that sounds familiar, maybe you might consider yourself a visual learner. Or, if reading or listening does the trick, maybe you feel like you’re a verbal learner. We call these labels learning styles. But is there really a way to categorize different types of students? Well, it actually seems that multiple presentation formats, especially if one of them is visual, help most people learn.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When psychologists and educators test for learning styles, they’re trying to figure out whether these are inherent traits that affect how well students learn instead of just a preference. Usually, they start by giving a survey to figure out what style a student favors, like visual or verbal learning. Then, they try to teach the students something with a specific presentation style, like using visual aids, and do a follow-up test to see how much they learned. That way, the researchers can see if the self-identified verbal learners really learned better when the information was just spoken aloud, for example.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But, according to a 2008 review, only one study that followed this design found that students actually learned best with their preferred style. But the study had some big flaws. The researchers excluded two-thirds of the original participants, because they didn’t seem to have any clear learning style from the survey at the beginning, and they didn’t even report the actual test scores in the final paper. So… it doesn’t really seem like learning styles are an inherent trait that we all have. But, that doesn’t mean that all students will do amazingly if they just spend all their time reading from a textbook.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Instead, most people seem to learn better if they’re taught in several ways—especially if one is visual. In one study, researchers tested whether students remembered lists of words better if they heard them, saw them, or both. And everyone seemed to do better if they got to see the words in print, even the self-identified auditory learners. Their preference didn’t seem to matter. Similar studies tested whether students learned basic physics and chemistry concepts better by reading plain text or viewing pictures too. And everyone did better with the help of pictures.</div>

B : To understand the mechanism of the human brain.
C : To categorize different types of learners.
D : To find out what students prefer to learn.
解析：细节题。音频中提到，心理学家和教育工作者做学习风格的测试，是为了弄清楚学习风格是影响学生学习质量的内在特质，还是只是一种学习偏好，所以选D。

Question：What does the speaker say about one study mentioned in the 2008 review?

***A : Visual aids are helpful to all types of learners.***
B : Auditory aids are as important as visual aids.
C : Scientific concepts are hard to understand without visual aids.
D : Reading plain texts is more effective than viewing pictures.
解析：细节题。音频结尾提到，如果使用多种学习方式，大多数人似乎都能够取得更好的学习效果，尤其是视觉学习方式。在一项研究中，研究人员让学生听单词表、看单词表或既听又看单词表，看他们能否更好地记住这些单词。结果是，如果能看到纸质版的单词，几乎每个学生都能记忆得更好，甚至包括那些自认为是听觉学习者的人。一些类似的研究测试了阅读纯文本或看图片是否能帮助学生更好地学习基本的物理和化学概念，在这些研究中，每个人都能通过看图片学得更好。由此可知，讲话者想表达的是，视觉学习对各种类型的学习者都有利，所以选B。

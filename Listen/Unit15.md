### Question 1000910402
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">Chinese real estate is projected to jump about 30% next year according to many forecasts. However the government may try to prevent a housing bubble in China by tightening credit markets. Some experts claim that the rebound in the Chinese property market is sustainable and could see real estate investment increase by 30% next year. According to a leading economist who advises the central bank, the real estate recovery will become a driving force in the economic recovery. “China's property industry can not only create great wealth but also form an important basis for sustainable economic growth,” he told a forum in south China. However, some other economists doubt whether the property revival can be sustained. They see price bubbles forming in some markets, inflated by a lending craze in the first half of the year. Still other economists believe that on the one hand property prices will most likely continue to rise in coming months, mainly because of tight money supply; on the other hand, the growth will slow when new housing units are released. One analyst said, “We believe a new supply will begin to increase again in September, which means the price increase will likely slow in the fourth quarter.” In spite of the controversy among economists, many prospective home buyers have become cautious and hesitated about buying homes amid concerns that the government may tighten credit in the real estate market and slow price growth in some cities. On the other hand, property developers are building more. The latest figures show that the housing units built by China's biggest developer Vanke has increased 45% this year.</div>

### Question 19154958
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">In last week’s lecture, we discussed the characteristics of the newly born offspring of several mammals. You probably remember that human infants are less developed physically than other mammals of the same age. But in today’s lecture, we’ll look at three very interesting studies that hint at the surprising abilities of human babies.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the first study, three-year-olds watched two videos shown side by side, each featuring a different researcher, one of whom they’d met once two years earlier. The children spent longer watching the video showing the researcher they hadn’t met. This is consistent with young children’s usual tendency to look longer at things that aren’t familiar. And really, this is amazing. It suggests the children remember the researcher they’ve met just one time when they were only one-year-olds. Of course, as most of us forget memories from our first few years as we grow older, these early long-term memories will likely be lost in subsequent years.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our second study is about music. For this study, researchers played music to babies through speakers located on either side of a human face. They waited until the babies got bored and averted their gaze from the face. And then they changed the mood of the music, either from sad to happy or the other way around. This mood switch made no difference to the three-month-olds; but for the nine-month-olds, it was enough to renew their interest and they started looking again in the direction of the face. This suggests that babies of that age can tell the difference between a happy melody and a sad tune.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our final study is from 1980, but it’s still relevant today. In fact, it’s one of the most famous pieces of research about infant emotion ever published. The study involved ordinary adults watching video clips of babies (nine months or younger). In the video clips, the babies made various facial expressions in response to real-life events, including playful interactions and painful ones. The adult observers were able to reliably discern an assortment of emotions on the babies’ faces. These emotions included interest, joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt and fear.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Next week, we’ll be looking at this last study more closely. In fact, we will be viewing some of the video clips from that study, and together, see how well we do in discerning the babies’ emotions.</div>

A : Adults’ influence on children.
B : Cognitive features of different newly born mammals.
***C : Abilities of human babies.***
D : Similarities between human babies and baby animals.
解析：细节题。音频开头提到，今天的讲座将提到三个有趣的研究，这些研究暗示了人类婴儿的惊人能力，所以选D。

Question：What does the second study find about nine-month-old babies?
音频：<audio id="audio" controls="" preload="none"><source id="mp3" src="https://itestres.unipus.cn/itest-product/quesres/hearmp3/b_1097/paper/202004/p_10103927/sucbxo_27160545017.mp3"></audio>
本地缓存路径：Unit15/19154958.mp3
A : They love happy melodies more than sad ones.
***B : They can distinguish a happy tune from a sad one.***
C : They are already sensitive to beats and rhythms.
D : They fall asleep easily while listening to music.
解析：细节题。音频中提到，音乐的基调发生变化对三个月大的婴儿没有什么影响；但是能够重新激发九个月大的婴儿的兴趣，他们会重新往人脸的方向看。这意味着九个月大的婴儿能够分辨快乐和悲伤的曲调，所以选A。

Question：What is the 1980 study about?
音频：<audio id="audio" controls="" preload="none"><source id="mp3" src="https://itestres.unipus.cn/itest-product/quesres/hearmp3/b_1097/paper/202004/p_10103927/qhifuf_27160545017.mp3"></audio>

A : Babies’ interaction with adults.
B : Infants’ behaviors.
C : Infants’ facial expressions.
***D : Babies’ emotions.***
解析：细节题。音频中提到，1980年的研究是迄今为止发表的关于婴儿情绪最著名的研究之一，所以选B。

### Question 1000910360
全文资源：<p style="text-align:justify">M: Jenny, are you crying? What’s wrong?</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: Oh Dad, I’m so worried about my first big project in freshman art class this semester. The project is due in two weeks, and it’s worth 25 percent of my final grade!</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: Jenny, you’re having trouble in art class? … But you’re wonderful at art. You love art! Everyone loves that series of pictures you painted of our cat, Giant!</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: Who wouldn’t love paintings of a small white cat named “Giant”? But that was in High School! &nbsp;This is the university where everyone is mature and behaves like an adult! I need excellent ideas! I need to be truly creative! University students must behave like real artists.</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: Oh honey, maybe that’s the problem here. First of all, life is a journey, not a destination. Adult behaviors emerge over time and you’re doing just fine! Your behaviors show us that you’re already traveling on the road to being a mature adult AND a mature artist.</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: Thanks Dad. It means a lot to hear that you and mom are proud of my adult behaviors. But I am really worried about my creativity for my art project. What if I create something wrong and everyone laughs at me?</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: Jenny, you can’t force creativity by worrying! The best behaviors for creativity are trial and error and some risk! You have to be able to take ideas and keep working with them for good art to grow. Be bold, Jenny!</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: Even if someone laughs or the art work is a failure?</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: Well, those are basic risks of art, and life. Right? Adults succeed in life because they are willing to risk, because they accept new challenges to be creative without being too afraid of the outcome. I believe in you, Jenny!</p>

### Question 19134649
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">Many people enjoy secret codes. The harder the code, the more some people would try to figure it out. In wartime, codes are especially important. They help army send news about battles and size of enemy forces. Neither side wants its code broken by the other. One very important code was never broken. It was used during World War II by the Americans. It was a spoken code, never written down and, it was developed and used by Navajo Indians. They were called the Navajo code talkers. The Navajos created the code in their own language. Navajo is hard to learn and only a few people know it, so it was pretty certain that the enemy would not be able to understand the code talkers. In addition, the talkers used code words. They called a submarine an iron fish and a small bomb thrown by hand a potato. If they wanted to spell something, they used code words for letters of the Alphabet. For instance, the letter A was ant or apple or ax. The code talkers worked mostly in the islands in the Pacific. One or two would be assigned to a group of soldiers. They would send messages by field telephone to the code talker in the next group. And he would relay the information to his commander. The code talkers played an important part in several battles. They helped the troops coordinate their movements and attacks. After the war, the U.S. government honored them for what they had accomplished. Theirs was the most successful wartime code ever used.</div>

### Question 19142106
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">Sepsis is the body’s “overwhelming and life-threatening response” to an infection. It can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. Sepsis can be caused by any type of infection, even a minor one, and occurs when germs enter a person’s body and multiply, causing illness and organ and tissue damage.<br />
<br />
Anyone can get sepsis&nbsp;from an infection, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk is higher in: people with weakened immune systems, babies and very young children, elderly people, people with chronic illnesses&nbsp;and people suffering from a severe burn or wound.<br />
<br />
There is no single sign or symptom of sepsis, but rather a combination of symptoms. Since it&nbsp;is the result of an infection, symptoms can include infection signs—such as vomiting, sore throat, etc.—as well as other symptoms&nbsp;such as shivering and fever, extreme pain, sleepiness and confusion, and shortness of breath.<br />
<br />
If you think you have an infection or sepsis, call your doctor or go to the emergency room right away. Doctors diagnose it&nbsp;by assessing vital signs, looking for high body temperature, increased heart rate and increased breathing rate. Many of its&nbsp;symptoms, though—such as fever and difficult breathing—are the same as other conditions, making it difficult to diagnose early. If you are continuing to feel worse or not getting better in the days after surgery, ask your doctor about it.<br />
<br />
Sepsis&nbsp;is treated with antibiotics administered as soon as possible. Other types of treatment, such as assisting breathing with a machine, might be necessary. Surgery is sometimes required to remove tissue damaged by the infection.<br />
<br />
Many people who get severe sepsis&nbsp;recover and are able to return to their normal lives. But some people experience permanent organ damage. For example, in someone who already has kidney problems, sepsis&nbsp;can lead to kidney failure that requires lifelong treatment.<br />
<br />
When it comes to prevention, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting vaccinated against the flu and other infections. It is also important that people&nbsp;practice&nbsp;good hygiene, such as regular bathing and hand washing.</div>

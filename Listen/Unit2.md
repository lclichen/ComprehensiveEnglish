### Question 11205
全文资源：<DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">W: Hey, Joe. What's all this talk about a benefit walkathon this weekend?<BR>M: Don't you know? Most of the residents in Parker Hall are going to try to walk the seven miles from the Engineering Library, across campus, and down to City Hall in an effort to raise money for the new children's hospital. <BR>W: Sounds like a good idea! But I don't understand where the money comes from. <BR>M: Well, a few days before the walkathon, each participant goes around asking people to pledge a certain amount of money for each mile that he or she expects to walk in the event. Then after the walkathon is over, the participants go back to those same people, collect the money pledged, and send it to the hospital. <BR>W: So you mean if you pledge, say, a dollar a mile and you walk five miles, then you get five dollars.<BR>M: That's right. Of course most of my friends aren't such big spenders. The biggest pledge I've gotten so far is 25 cents a mile. <BR>W: And how many people have made pledges for you? <BR>M: Eleven so far. Say, how about making it a dozen? <BR>W: Sure. If you'll do the same for me. The walkathon sounds like the perfect opportunity for me to break in my new pair of sports shoes.<BR>&nbsp;</DIV>

### Question 11126
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hello, I am Harriet Smith. As the editor of <em>The Voice</em>, I'd like to introduce you to our <em>Campus Daily</em>. We need volunteers to assist us in keeping our student body informed through our newspaper.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Experiences are absolutely necessary, and writing and typing skills are also important. We need people to rewrite articles, to type and to proofread. We'd also need a good photographer. Although many of our staff members are journalism majors, we also have several engineers and pre-law students working for us. Since <em>The Voice</em> comes out five days a week, we need excellent students who know how to budget their time efficiently.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Good grades are a prerequisite for working on the paper. There is some money for salaries, depending on how involved you get with the paper, but don't expect to get rich. This isn't something for the money. Mostly it's just for fun.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone who is interested in joining the staff should speak to me immediately after the meeting. Be prepared to start right away. The first issue goes to press tomorrow.<br />&nbsp;</div>

### Question 19141469
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">Today I’m going to talk about a very special kind of person. Psychologists call them “masters of deception”. Those rare individuals with a natural ability to tell with complete confidence when someone is telling a lie. For decades, researchers and law enforcement agencies have tried to build a machine that will do the same thing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now, a company in Massachusetts says that by using magnetic brain scans, they can determine with 97% accuracy whether someone is telling the truth. They hope that the technology will be cleared for use in American courts by early next year. But is this really the ultimate tool for you, the lawyers of tomorrow? You will not find many brain scientists celebrating this breakthrough. The company might be very optimistic, but the ability of their machine to detect deception has not provided credible proof. That’s because the technology has not been properly tested in real-world situations. In life, there are different kinds of lies and diverse contexts in which they’re told. These differences may elicit different brain responses. Does their hypothesis behind the test apply in every case? We don’t know the answer, because studies done on how reliable this machine is have not yet been duplicated. Much more research is badly needed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Whether the technology is eventually deemed reliable enough for the courts will ultimately be decided by the judges. Let’s hope they’re wise enough not to be fooled by a machine that claims to determine truthfulness at the flick of a switch. They should also be sceptical of the growing tendency to try to reduce all human traits and actions to the level of brain activity. Often, they do not map that easily.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, understanding the brain is not the same as understanding the mind. Some researchers have suggested that thoughts cannot properly be seen as purely internal. Instead, thoughts make sense only in reference to the individual’s external world. So while there may be insights to be gained from matching behavior to brain activity, those insights will not necessarily lead to justice in a court of law. Problems surround the use of machines to spot deception, at least until it has been rigorously tested.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A high-tech test that can tell when a person is not telling the truth sounds too good to be true. And when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</div>

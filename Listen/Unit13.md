### Question 1000910445
全文资源：<p>W: Have you finished playing your video game? Let’s go to see that new comedy at the movie theater.</p><p>M: Susan, did you say comedy? We’re not going to a comedy. We’re going to the new action movie, right?</p><p>W: Ugh! I hate those kinds of movies. I don’t want to see an action movie! You’ve played violent video games all day! Enough violence! You spend hours every day playing those violent video games, and then you want to go to see violent movies. Violence and more violence! It’s not healthy, John!</p><p>M: That’s not all I do. I just like those kinds of things – not real violence, but action movies and video games are fun. I don’t know why you don’t want me to have fun or play these games with me.</p><p>W: Why are you making it my problem? Of course I want you to have fun, but it needs to be healthy! All of this violence is not good for you, and it’s not good for us in our relationship. Honestly, John, how can you feel romantic toward me, your wife, after playing a violent video game for three hours?</p><p>M: OK, Susan, good point. I guess I’ve had enough violence for today.</p><p>W: Listen, let’s head out to the movies. I’m excited. Let’s go to the new movie theater with the special sound system at the corner of 8th Street and Main Street.</p><p>M: Yeah! That’s a great idea! I love seeing movies in a theater where the sound is all around you. And most of all, I like sitting next to the woman I love watching a great movie! How about some popcorn?</p><p>W: Absolutely! Love you!!</p><p>M: Love you, too! And hey, you look really beautiful tonight!</p>

全文资源：<p style="text-align:justify">W: Thanks for dropping by my office today, Jim. Please have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.<br />
M: Thanks. So why’d you want to see me today, Cindy?<br />
W: As you know, we do our annual employee evaluations every August, but since this is your first year here as a salesman at Door to Door Storage Units, we’re doing a six-month check-up to see how things are going and answer any questions you have so far. Anything you’d like to talk about, Jim?<br />
M: Well, sales are going well. Nothing serious to discuss, really, except… uh… well… I have been meaning to ask&nbsp; about my boss, Susan Jones. She seems kind of worried and jumpy. I really do&nbsp;like her as a boss – and just want to make sure I haven’t done anything to upset her…...<br />
W:&nbsp; No, no Jim. In fact, I know that Susan is quite pleased with your work. It has nothing to do with you. It’s just that she recently moved here from our New York City sales branch and I think she’s having a little trouble adjusting to the southern lifestyle and slower way of life here in Atlanta, Georgia. Give her some time and she’ll be warm to you.<br />
M: Gosh – thanks for letting me know, Cindy. I feel a lot better! I’m from Atlanta and I can’t imagine how I’d feel if someone moved me and my family to New York City! I’ll spend some time getting to know Susan and her family at the company picnic on Friday.<br />
W: That would be really nice; I think she’d appreciate having a friendly face at the picnic. See you Friday!</p><p style="text-align:justify">New words:</p><p style="text-align:justify">Atlanta 亚特兰大（美国佐治亚州首府）</p><p style="text-align:justify">Georgia 美国佐治亚州</p>

### Question 1000910403
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">Genes are the parts of cells that control the growth of living things, including people. Now, a company in Iceland is working to create the most detailed map yet of all known human genes. Doctor Karl Stefansson, head of the company, believes that the people of Iceland present a special chance to study the human genome and how some genes cause disease. Iceland has a very small population—about 280,000 people. The majority of the population shares a small group of common ancestors who lived thousands of years ago. The people of Iceland keep extensive records of their ancestors. In addition, Iceland has an excellent healthcare system. Doctor Stefansson says his researchers are studying genetic diseases in many families over hundreds of years. So far, researchers have examined the genes of at least 146 families. The Iceland genome project is using a much larger group of individuals to observe differences in human genes than any other project. For example, American scientists made a genetic map based on only eight large families in France. Human beings have almost exactly the same genes. Small genetic differences make us look different from each other. These differences can also make us more likely to get some diseases. The company's main project is to identify genes that cause disease. Scientists believe most common diseases are caused by several abnormal genes working together. The company claims to have already found three disease-causing genes, linking to a mental disease and two kinds of strokes.</div>

### Question 19142112
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">As the rich get richer, the world has entered an “age of charity”, with education the most popular focus of some 260,000 foundations globally, researchers said recently.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Increasing numbers of rich individuals, families and corporations are setting up foundations for social investment amid persistent inequality, said study author Paula Johnson of Harvard University.&nbsp;“Due to the rapid growth of wealth around the world, more individuals and families have the ability to create charity capital.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The richest 1 percent of the world’s population owns half of its wealth, up from 43 percent in 2008, propelled in part by gains in financial assets, like stocks and bonds.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many super rich Americans have set up foundations which run their own programs or give grants, including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are more than 15 million millionaires and close to 2,000 billionaires in the world, while 10 percent of the population live on less than $1.90 a day, said the report, which was funded by a Swiss bank.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Globally, foundations have combined assets of $1.5 trillion—slightly more than the U.S. federal government’s 2018 budget—the report found in an assessment of 39 countries around the world, including in Asia, Latin America and Africa.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The sector is notable for its youth and recent growth. Almost three-quarters of 80,000 foundations were started in the last 25 years.&nbsp;If this continues, charity will surely have an increasingly significant social and economic impact, the report said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many wealthy people were driven by a sense of moral obligation, as well as a fear that “when inequality becomes too acute it may threaten peace, stability, and the free enterprise system that created such wealth”, it&nbsp;said.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Education was the main funding focus globally, followed by social welfare, health, arts and culture and reducing poverty.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Education is seen as both a way to provide for individual opportunity—to bring individuals out of poverty—and at the same time as an engine for national growth,” Johnson said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Researchers were unable to get data from a large number of countries. About 95 percent of foundations surveyed were in Europe and the United States, where governments use tax incentives to encourage charity.</div>

I need you to get them back!</p><p>M: Umm, ma’am, I know you’re very upset … But here in Los Angles, a car gets broken into every 11 minutes. It’s too bad, but you probably won’t see your camera and cell phone again.</p><p>W: Is that all you can do?! Why won’t you go out and catch the criminals that did this? What are the police for, to just stand here and take reports?</p><p>M: Ma’am, I know you are very upset and frustrated; I’m sorry. Do you have the serial numbers from the lost items?

### Question 11005
全文资源：<p>W: I want to register for this mathematics course.<br />
M: I'm sorry. Registration is closed.<br />
W: Closed? The clerk told me I can come back and register anytime during the first week of the classes.<br />
M: Well, that's not possible. The computer's official student account has already been sent to the state. And that's what our budget is based on. Who told you that anyway?<br />
W: A woman here when I tried to register three weeks ago. She said I just had to pay a late fee.<br />
M: She must be a temporary worker. They don't have much training. Why didn't you register then?<br />
W: She said I couldn't until I had my birth certificate. Here it is.<br />
M: Your birth certificate?<br />
W: Well, I'm a new part-time student, so she asked for identification. I don't drive, so I don't have a driver's license.<br />
M: Hm. There's no reason to demand a birth certificate. We only need to establish residency. A phone bill with your name and address on would be fine.<br />
W: Really? Only proof of my address?<br />
M: Yes. I'm afraid she gave you the wrong information. Still, you have to wait and take your math class next semester.<br />
W: But that's not fair.<br />
M: Well, I sympathize with your problem, but frankly, I don't think there's anything anyone can do for you. You're trapped in the system. If you want to, you can talk to the director. She'll help if she can.<br />
W: Great!<br />
M: Don't get your hopes up!&nbsp;</p>

### Question 10886
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; Train passengers are welcoming the authorities' plan to sell train tickets online but remain concerned that the system will not be that user-friendly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;More passengers have shifted from buying tickets at railway stations and ticket outlets to telephone and online bookings, which eliminates the aggravation of waiting in line and may also help reduce selling tickets at a higher price by some agencies.<br />&nbsp; Zhang Qian, a 26-year-old Beijing resident, said she was very happy to know tickets for more trains would be available online.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang, who works in Beijing, said the new move would let her to book train tickets home with only one click of the mouse at home.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Rui, a 27-year-old student at Tsinghua University, said online purchase is better than making phone reservation. Phone service has long been provided by the Railway Ministry but usually takes a lot longer.<br />&nbsp; &quot;It is clearer and more interactive to submit your request online,&quot; he said.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still uses the hotline because it allows him to book a seat on slow trains, which cannot be ticketed online as yet.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;However, foreigners may find it hard to use the service as the online purchase website is only in Chinese.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Many foreigners view the worst thing about buying a train ticket in China is queuing up. They can only buy tickets after queuing a long time in front of the ticket windows. So they think it would be perfect if the service can be extended to international passengers.<span style="font-family: 宋体; font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 宋体; mso-font-kerning: 0pt" lang="EN-US"></span></div>

### Question 19154957
全文资源：<p style="text-align:justify">Dating from as far back as the 12th century, they are claimed to be the rarest historic buildings in western Europe. These buildings offer vital insight into Scandinavia’s Viking past. But now, with only 30 wooden churches remaining and their condition deteriorating, experts are working to preserve the structures for future generations. Some of these spectacular churches are no more than small buildings, barely four metres wide and six metres tall. Others are much larger structures that soar up to 40 metres into the cold air. Most consist of timber frames that rest on stone blocks. This means that they have no foundations. Although many of the churches appear from the outside to be complex structures, they normally feature only a single storey but numerous different roof levels.<br />
<br />
Staff from the Norwegian government have carried out conservation work on 10 of the churches over the past two years. Most of these churches date from between the 12th and 14th centuries. Other churches were conserved in previous years. So far, specialists have worked to add preservative materials to the churches’ exteriors. They also replaced rotting roots and halted the sinking of the churches into the ground. In two cases, huge machines have been used to lift the buildings up to 30 centimetres into the air. This was accomplished so that the team could examine and repair the churches’ original medieval stone blocks. The team plans to return to around a dozen of the buildings to assess progress and consider further action.<br />
<br />
The earliest free-standing wooden church was probably built in Norway in around 1080. However, the largest known wooden churches were built from the 1130s onwards. This period was one of inter-elite rivalry, in which nobles sought to increase their influence by funding the construction of churches and other buildings. The reason for constructing the buildings from wood is probably that ideally proportioned straight and slender timber was available in large quantities in Scandinavia’s vast pine forests. As wood was so plentiful, it was cheaper to use than the stone used in the buildings of other European cultures. The area’s ship-building tradition, partly established by the Vikings, also meant that sophisticated carpentry was a major aspect of the local culture. The complex style of the medieval wooden church carvings and the skills used to make them almost certainly derive from the ancient Viking tradition.</p>

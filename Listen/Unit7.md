### Question 10905
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">M: Hi, May, how about going swimming this weekend?</div><p style="text-align:justify">W: Oh, sorry, Rob, I don't know how to swim.</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: Really? I think swimming is a very popular activity in the UK and it is said that four in five adults in the UK are good swimmers.</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: You're right. Most people recognize that swimming is very important for safety and good for fitness. But maybe some people weren't introduced to the water early enough and they don't have the confidence to start swimming later in life. Just like me.</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: And in fact experts say that the best time to learn is when we're babies&nbsp;or children.</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: That makes sense. I think a lot of babies are natural swimmers, so it's good for them to be in the water from an early age.</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: As long as they've been supervised well.</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: Definitely! Babies as young as three months old can start swimming. But there are still many people like me who didn't start learning swimming in our childhood. What can those people do?</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: Ah, well there are a number of schemes to encourage people to swim. I know one called "Big Slash", which celebrates swimming and wants to get more people into the water, whether they're adults or children.</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: That sounds wonderful. Can you tell me more about this scheme?</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: They always arrange many swimming classes for adults and the coach will use some techniques to encourage adults to swim.</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: I am interested in it. Do you know how I can participate?</p><p style="text-align:justify">M: Well, this Saturday in Central Pool they will hold an orientation session for beginners. If you have time, you can go and have a look.</p><p style="text-align:justify">W: Oh, thanks a lot.</p>

音频：<audio id="audio" controls="" preload="none"><source id="mp3" src="https://itestres.unipus.cn/itest-product/resourcefile/201310/710/20131018171232455.mp3"></audio>

A : It makes sense because children can learn everything in a quick pace.
B : It makes sense because children are fond of water.
***C : It makes sense because children have some natural instinct to learn how to swim.***
D : It makes sense because children don't know fear as they are so young.
解析：音频中男士告诉女士，据专家称，最佳学习游泳的时间是babies or children。女士同意他的观点，她认为儿童天生就是很好的游泳者（a lot of babies are natural swimmers），言下之意就是他们对于游泳这一运动有一种自然本能。因此此题应选C。

解析：从音频中可知Big Slash是一个教游泳的项目，教学对象是成人和儿童，里面的教练懂得运用技巧鼓励成人克服入水的恐惧。音频中并未提及此项目的具体时间和日期，因此A不正确；此项目的对象既有儿童也有成人，因此B也不正确；音频中并未提及学员可以在此项目中学到些游泳技巧，而是说教练会运用些技巧鼓励成年人学习游泳，因此C也不够准确，所以选D。

### Question 19154954
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">Related to the use-it-or-lose-it law is the keep-moving principle. We learn about stagnation from nature: a river that stops moving gets smelly. The same thing happens to people who stop moving, either mentally or physically. Those who play contact sports know that the player who usually gets hurt the most is the one who is standing still. Of course, you’ll need some time to catch your breath every so often, but the essential massage is keep moving, extending and learning. Ships last a lot longer when they go to sea than when they stay in the harbor. The same is true for airplanes. You don’t preserve an airplane by keeping it on the ground. You preserve it by keeping it in service. We also get to live a long healthy life by staying in service. Longevity statistics reveal that the average person doesn’t last very long after retirement. The moral here is “don’t retire”. If a fellow says “I’m 94 years old and I worked all my life”, we need to realize that is how we got to be 94—by staying involved. George Bernard Shaw won a Nobel Prize when he was nearly 70. Benjamin Franklin produced some of his best writings at the age of 84. And Pablo Picasso put brush to canvas right through his eighties. Isn’t the issue how old we think we are? A bonus with the keep-moving principle is that while we keep moving, we don’t have a chance to worry. Hence, we avoid the dreaded “paralysis by analysis”.</div>

### Question 19154957
全文资源：Dating from as far back as the 12th century, they are claimed to be the rarest historic buildings in western Europe. These buildings offer vital insight into Scandinavia’s Viking past. But now, with only 30 wooden churches remaining and their condition deteriorating, experts are working to preserve the structures for future generations. Some of these spectacular churches are no more than small buildings, barely four metres wide and six metres tall. Others are much larger structures that soar up to 40 metres into the cold air. Most consist of timber frames that rest on stone blocks. This means that they have no foundations. Although many of the churches appear from the outside to be complex structures, they normally feature only a single storey but numerous different roof levels.<br />
<br />
Staff from the Norwegian government have carried out conservation work on 10 of the churches over the past two years. Most of these churches date from between the 12th and 14th centuries. Other churches were conserved in previous years. So far, specialists have worked to add preservative materials to the churches’ exteriors. They also replaced rotting roots and halted the sinking of the churches into the ground. In two cases, huge machines have been used to lift the buildings up to 30 centimetres into the air. This was accomplished so that the team could examine and repair the churches’ original medieval stone blocks. The team plans to return to around a dozen of the buildings to assess progress and consider further action.<br />
<br />
The earliest free-standing wooden church was probably built in Norway in around 1080. However, the largest known wooden churches were built from the 1130s onwards. This period was one of inter-elite rivalry, in which nobles sought to increase their influence by funding the construction of churches and other buildings. The reason for constructing the buildings from wood is probably that ideally proportioned straight and slender timber was available in large quantities in Scandinavia’s vast pine forests. As wood was so plentiful, it was cheaper to use than the stone used in the buildings of other European cultures. The area’s ship-building tradition, partly established by the Vikings, also meant that sophisticated carpentry was a major aspect of the local culture. The complex style of the medieval wooden church carvings and the skills used to make them almost certainly derive from the ancient Viking tradition.</p>

### Question 11185
全文资源：<DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">M: You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe. When are you leaving? <BR>W: In just three weeks. And I am excited. But there are still a few things I need to do before I go. <BR>M: Like what? <BR>W: Like renewing my passport, going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket, and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone. <BR>M: You are not going to give it up, are you? <BR>W: No way. I'll never find another apartment around here. But I don't like the idea of paying three months' rent on an empty apartment, either. <BR>M: Perhaps you could sublet it. <BR>W: Yes, but who to? <BR>M: Mmm, let me think. Oh, I just know a person. An old colleague of mine, Jim Thomas, is coming here to do some research this summer from June through August. <BR>W: That's exactly when I'll be away. It sounds ideal as long as the landlord agrees. <BR>M: Tell you what. I'll be calling Jim late this week, anyway. So I'll mention it to him then. <BR>W: Now, thanks, Bill. Let me know what happens. That extra money will really come in handy. <BR>&nbsp;</DIV>

### Question 11066
全文资源：<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty years ago London could have claimed the title "Smog City, Europe". Three fourths of its smoke is gone now and the remarkable change was caused by a series of killer fogs in the late 1950s and early 1960s.</p><P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst of these settled over London on December 5th, 1952. For four continuous days the city's normal daily death rate was over 50, and, in all, some 4,000 extra deaths that winter were blamed on the incident. More such fogs came in the winters that followed. Each gave people a big alarm.</p><P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1956 Parliament passed the Clean Air Act, declaring that factories and homes in critical areas of the city must switch from soft high sulphur coal to less smoky fuels: hard coal, gas, electricity, or oil. Inevitably there were economic problems and complaints, both to householders and to industries. But, with each passing year, London's air grew cleaner.</p><P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; London has proved that the veil of smog can be cast off, but its success story stands almost alone. In sunny Spain, Madrid has joined the ranks of fog cities. In Italy, acid from smog cuts into centuries old sculpture. And each rain here in Washington washes more acid onto our marble buildings and monuments.</p><P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The massive struggle to clean our air began so recently that victory seems far off. But we have taken an important step and we realize we must do something. In the frequently quoted words of Pogo, "We have met the enemy, and he is us."</P>

A : Illustrate the bad effects of smog to buildings.
B : Praise London for cleaning off smog.
***C : Appeal to American people to act against smog.***
D : Introduce the Clean Air Act.
解析：文章主题句一般会出现在首段或尾段。此问题出现在最后可以推断，尾段是我们解答此题的关键。最后一段提到：struggle to clean our air, victory seems far off, we have taken...step, we realize we must do something等等，这些信息点说明，作者借本文号召大家采取行动，战胜烟雾。由上题可知，作者身处美国，故呼吁的对象是美国人。所以选D。
### Question 19154958
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">In last week’s lecture, we discussed the characteristics of the newly born offspring of several mammals. You probably remember that human infants are less developed physically than other mammals of the same age. But in today’s lecture, we’ll look at three very interesting studies that hint at the surprising abilities of human babies.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the first study, three-year-olds watched two videos shown side by side, each featuring a different researcher, one of whom they’d met once two years earlier. The children spent longer watching the video showing the researcher they hadn’t met. This is consistent with young children’s usual tendency to look longer at things that aren’t familiar. And really, this is amazing. It suggests the children remember the researcher they’ve met just one time when they were only one-year-olds. Of course, as most of us forget memories from our first few years as we grow older, these early long-term memories will likely be lost in subsequent years.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our second study is about music. For this study, researchers played music to babies through speakers located on either side of a human face. They waited until the babies got bored and averted their gaze from the face. And then they changed the mood of the music, either from sad to happy or the other way around. This mood switch made no difference to the three-month-olds; but for the nine-month-olds, it was enough to renew their interest and they started looking again in the direction of the face. This suggests that babies of that age can tell the difference between a happy melody and a sad tune.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our final study is from 1980, but it’s still relevant today. In fact, it’s one of the most famous pieces of research about infant emotion ever published. The study involved ordinary adults watching video clips of babies (nine months or younger). In the video clips, the babies made various facial expressions in response to real-life events, including playful interactions and painful ones. The adult observers were able to reliably discern an assortment of emotions on the babies’ faces. These emotions included interest, joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt and fear.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Next week, we’ll be looking at this last study more closely. In fact, we will be viewing some of the video clips from that study, and together, see how well we do in discerning the babies’ emotions.</div>

***A : They can distinguish a happy tune from a sad one.***
B : They are already sensitive to beats and rhythms.
C : They fall asleep easily while listening to music.

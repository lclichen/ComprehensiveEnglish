### Question 1000864061
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">M: How did it go at the bank this morning?<br />
W: Not well. My proposal was rejected.<br />
M: Really? But why?<br />
W: Bunch of reasons. For starters, they said my credit history was not good enough.<br />
M: Did they say how you could improve that?<br />
W: Yes. They said that after five more years of paying my mortgage, then I would become a more viable candidate for a business loan. But right now it’s too risky for them to lend me money. They fear I will default on any business loan I’m given.<br />
M: Well, that doesn’t sound fair. Your business idea is amazing. Did you show them your business plan? What did they say?<br />
W: They didn’t really articulate any position regarding the actual business plan. They simply looked at my credit history and determined it was not good enough. They said the bank has strict guidelines and requirements as to who they can lend money to. And I simply don’t meet their financial threshold.<br />
M: What if you asked for a smaller amount? Maybe you could gather capital from other sources. Smaller loans from more lenders?<br />
W: You don’t get it. It doesn’t matter the size of the loan I ask for, or the type of business I propose. That’s all inconsequential. The first thing every bank will do is study how much money I have and how much debt I have before they decide whether or not to lend me any more money. If I want to continue ahead with this dream of owning my own business, I have no other choice but to build up my own finances. I need around 20% more in personal savings and 50% less debt. That’s all there is to it.<br />
M: I see now. Well, it’s a huge pity that they rejected your request, but don’t lose hope. I still think that your idea is great and that you would turn it into a phenomenal success.</div>

### Question 11186
全文资源：<DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1946 there was a program in the Rio Grande valley to substitute the hybrid corn, which is produced by mixing several types of corn, for the native corn. The native corn was of poor nutritional quality and gave a poor quantity of grain, while the hybrid corn was of excellent quality and gave about three times as large a crop as the native variety. In the first year, half of the 84 farmers in the village planted the hybrid corn and doubled the corn production. Three years later, however, only three farmers planted the hybrid corn. The others were planting the traditional variety. At the beginning of the project, the program leader studied the pattern of the natural relations of plants, animals, and people to each other and to their surroundings of the area and showed films demonstrating the superiority of the new corn. The farmers agreed that the hybrid corn had great advantages. The size of the corn confirmed these advantages. Why did they stop planting it? They complained that it wasn't good for cooking and they didn't like the flavor.</DIV>

### Question 19154945
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">Free-market capitalism hasn’t freed us; it has trapped us. It’s imperative for us to embrace a workplace revolution. We’re unlikely to spend our last moments regretting that we didn’t spend enough of our lives slaving away at work. We may instead find ourselves feeling guilty about the time we didn’t spend watching our children grow, or with our loved ones, or travelling, or on the cultural or leisure pursuits that bring us happiness. Unfortunately, the average full-time employee in the world works 42 hours a week—well over a third of the time we’re awake. Some of our all too precious time is being stolen: office workers do around 2 billion hours of unpaid overtime each year. So it’s extremely welcome that some government coalitions have started looking into potentially cutting the working week to four days.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The champions of free-market capitalism promised their way of life would bring us freedom. But it wasn’t freedom at all: from the lack of secure, affordable housing to growing job insecurity and rising personal debt, the individual is trapped. Nine decades ago, leading economists predicted that technological advances and rising productivity would mean that we’d be working a 15-hour week by now. That target has been somewhat missed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here is the most malignant threat to our personal freedom, particularly as the balance of power in the workplace has been shifted so dramatically from worker to boss. A huge portion of our lives involves the surrender of our freedom and personal autonomy. It’s time in which we are directed by the needs and desires of others, and denied the right to make our own choices. That’s bad for us. It’s hardly surprising that over half a million workers suffer from work-related mental health conditions each year, or that 15.4 million working days were lost to work-related stress last year, a jump of nearly a quarter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yes, there are those who, far from being overworked, actually seek more hours. But a shorter working week would enable us to redistribute hours from the overworked to the underworked. We need to look at ways of cutting the working week without slashing living standards. After all, the world’s workers have already suffered the worst deduction in wages since the early 1800s. And cutting the working week would be conducive to the individual, giving millions of workers more time to spend as they see fit.</div>

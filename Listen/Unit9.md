### Question 19143197
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">W: Hi, my name is Kathy. Nice to meet you!<br />
M: Nice to meet you, too, Kathy. My name is John. I’m a university friend of the bride. What about you? Who do you know at this party?<br />
W: I am a colleague of Brenda. I was a little surprised to be invited, to be honest. We’ve only been working together the last six months, but we quickly became good friends. We just wrapped up a project with a difficult client last week. I bet Brenda is glad it’s done with, and she can focus on wedding preparations.<br />
M: Oh, yes. So you’re Kathy from the office. Actually, I’ve heard a lot about you and that project. The client sounded like a real nightmare!<br />
W: Oh, he was. I mean we deal with all kinds of people on a regular basis. It’s part of the job, but he was especially particular, enough about that. What line of work are you in?<br />
M: Well, right out of college, I worked in advertising for a while. Recently, though, I turn my photography hobby into a small business. I’ll actually be taking photos during the big event as a wedding gift.<br />
W: That sounds wonderful and very thoughtful of you. I bake, just as a hobby. But Brenda has asked me to do the cake for the wedding. I was a bit nervous saying yes, because I’m far from a professional.<br />
M: Did you bake the cookies here at the party tonight?<br />
W: Yes, I got the idea from a magazine.<br />
M: They’re delicious! You’ve got nothing to worry about. You’re a natural.<br />
W: You really think so?<br />
M: If you hadn’t told me that, I would have guessed they were baked by the restaurant. You know, with your event-planning experience, you could very well open your own shop.<br />
W: Ha, ha! One step at a time. First, I’ll see how baking the wedding cake goes. If it’s not a disaster, maybe I’ll give it some more thought.&nbsp;</div>

### Question 19143052
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">W: Hi, Mark! How is it going?<br />
M: Well, not so great.<br />
W: What’s wrong?<br />
M: I’ve got a big problem with the poetry course that’s required for my major.<br />
W: Is that all filled up?<br />
M: No, no, there is plenty of room, but there is a prerequisite. I’ve got to take an introduction to poetry before I can take the special course in poets of the 1960s and the introductory courses only offered in the evenings.<br />
W: You don’t like evening classes?<br />
M: No, that’s not the point. I work in the cafeteria every evening. I need the money to pay my tuition.<br />
W: Can you ask someone that works there to switch hours with you? Maybe you could just switch a couple of evenings, since the course probably only meets two times a week.<br />
M: I wish I could. The boss just did me a favor by putting me on evenings, and he’ll hit the ceiling if I ask to change again.<br />
W: Wait a minute! I have an idea. Have you checked the courses over at the community college? They might offer introductory poetry courses during the day.<br />
M: Hey! That’s a great idea. I’m free this afternoon. I think I’ll go over and check it out.<br />
W: Yeah, their courses are actually cheaper and you can transfer the credits over here.<br />
M: Thanks for the advice, Linda. I’ll let you know what happens.<br />
W: Sure, Mark! Good luck!</div>

### Question 19154941
全文资源：<div style="text-align:justify">There’s a lot about Leo Sanchez and his farm in Salinas, California that seems unusual. The national average farm size is around 440 acres, but his is only one acre. The average age of farmers hovers around 58 years old, but he is just 26. And Sanchez constantly attempts to improve everything from seeding techniques out in the field to the promotion and sale of his produce online. This is evidence of an experimental approach. It’s an approach not dictated by the confines of conventional, large-scale agriculture led by international corporations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While farming is often difficult for both the body and mind, Sanchez says he and many of his fellow young farmers are motivated by a desire to set a new standard for agriculture. Many of them are employing a multitude of technologies, some new and some… not so new. Recently, Sanchez bought a hand-operated tool which pulls out weeds and loosens soil. It actually dates back to at least 1701. It stands in sharp contrast to Sanchez’s other gadget, a gas-powered flame weed killer invented in 1997. He simply doesn’t discriminate when it comes to the newness of tools. If it works, it works. Farmers have a long history of invention and is no different today. Young farmers are guided by their love for agriculture and aided by their knowledge of technology. To find inexpensive and appropriately-sized tools, they collaborate and innovate. Sometimes the old stuff just works better or more efficiently.</div>

### Question 19154945
全文资源：<div style="text-align: justify;">Free-market capitalism hasn’t freed us; it has trapped us. It’s imperative for us to embrace a workplace revolution. We’re unlikely to spend our last moments regretting that we didn’t spend enough of our lives slaving away at work. We may instead find ourselves feeling guilty about the time we didn’t spend watching our children grow, or with our loved ones, or travelling, or on the cultural or leisure pursuits that bring us happiness. Unfortunately, the average full-time employee in the world works 42 hours a week—well over a third of the time we’re awake. Some of our all too precious time is being stolen: office workers do around 2 billion hours of unpaid overtime each year. So it’s extremely welcome that some government coalitions have started looking into potentially cutting the working week to four days.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The champions of free-market capitalism promised their way of life would bring us freedom. But it wasn’t freedom at all: from the lack of secure, affordable housing to growing job insecurity and rising personal debt, the individual is trapped. Nine decades ago, leading economists predicted that technological advances and rising productivity would mean that we’d be working a 15-hour week by now. That target has been somewhat missed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here is the most malignant threat to our personal freedom, particularly as the balance of power in the workplace has been shifted so dramatically from worker to boss. A huge portion of our lives involves the surrender of our freedom and personal autonomy. It’s time in which we are directed by the needs and desires of others, and denied the right to make our own choices. That’s bad for us. It’s hardly surprising that over half a million workers suffer from work-related mental health conditions each year, or that 15.4 million working days were lost to work-related stress last year, a jump of nearly a quarter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yes, there are those who, far from being overworked, actually seek more hours. But a shorter working week would enable us to redistribute hours from the overworked to the underworked. We need to look at ways of cutting the working week without slashing living standards. After all, the world’s workers have already suffered the worst deduction in wages since the early 1800s. And cutting the working week would be conducive to the individual, giving millions of workers more time to spend as they see fit.</div>
